# Custom Dev and TA Conference Day
**Serverless** is about to become the programming model of the future, and in this session we will explore why. We will leave the public cloud offerings aside (no lambda, no cloud-functions) but instead have a look at on-premise serverless, which is enabled through container-based architectures.

We will meet in a chatroom and develop bots with serverless functions in javascript (nodejs) and python.
